# Google Homepage

The goal of this project is to *recreate Google's homepage* using knowledge of HTML/CSS.

This is my solution to [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home)'s
HTML/CSS challenge, see it live here: [**Google**](https://pa-aggarwal.github.io/google-homepage/).

## Project Takeaways

* Using the CSS property `filter` to change an image's colour.
* Making effective usage of CSS flexbox for navigation layout.
* How to use absolute positioning to position elements in specific parts of the page.
* Creating proper nested lists in HTML.

## Future TODO's

* Add functionality to search-bar.
* Point all links to respective sources and not nowhere.
* Make webpage responsive for various screen sizes.
